# Arduino Digital & Analog Sensors 
This project contains designing and programing to two sensors in Tinkercad

## Components used:
- Arduino 
- Push Button 
- Potentiometer 
- 2x LEDs 
- Resistors ( 220K - 10K ohm )
- Breadboard

## Wiring:
#### 1- Digital  
Push button is the digital input. One side is connected to arduino D2, the other to 5V.
one led is the digital output.

#### 2- Analog  
Potentiometer is the analog input. Middle pin to A0, left pin to 5V, right pin to GND.
The other led is the analog output.
